    <p class="text">Here's a short story: In the city of Mahilaropya, there was a saint who lived a very simple life. Every day, he would go into the city seeking
    alms. He would then cook his food and distribute the leftovers to the disciples who helped him take care of the temple.
    Though the disciples were thankful for the hermit, they faced a common problem- a troublesome mouse.
    
    There was a mouse near the temple which would eat all the leftovers before the hermit could even distribute it to the
    people. The hermit decided to put the leftovers in an earthen pot and hang it off of the roof in the hopes that the
    mouse won’t be able to reach it. But the mouse formed a pile out of all the stolen food and used the pile to climb up
    and steal food from the hanging pot. The disciples and the hermit were baffled by how the mouse was managing to steal
    food.
    
    One day, the hermit’s friend noticed him looking sad and frustrated. When questioned about his state, the hermit told
    him the story of the thieving mouse and his failure to get rid of it. The friend thought about the problem and suggested
    that the hermit should destroy the pile of food since that’s what’s helping the mouse reach the food. Taking his
    friend’s advice, the hermit burnt the pile of food to the ground. Without its pile of food, the mouse couldn’t reach the
    food and steal it anymore. After trying for a few days, the mouse left the temple looking for a new source of food.
    
    Moral: A true friend will help you when life gets tough.
